# JavaScript Game

This is a project that is meant to help me re-learn js.

This game will be similar to [A Dark Room](https://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/).

## How does the system work?

After each dialogue, the player will be given two or more choices that they can make. Each choice will devolve into another branch of the story.

I'll also add some idle elements.
