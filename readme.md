# JavaScript Game

This is a project that is meant to help me re-learn js.

This game will be similar to [A Dark Room](https://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/).

## How does the system work?

This is a game about a regular guy in a fantasy world trying to make $$$.

He starts by begging on the street, they then improve their job and make more coins.

After each dialogue, the player will be given two or more choices that they can make. Each choice will devolve into another branch of the story.
